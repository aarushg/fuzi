# FUZI Operations Portal

Flask-powered operations and customer portal for FUZI Classic Elevators. The public website is served from static HTML files, while `/portal` provides a protected staff dashboard and `/customer` provides a separate customer-facing portal for quotes, payment tracking, and project status.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
.venv/bin/python app.py
```

| URL | Description |
|---|---|
| `http://127.0.0.1:5000/portal/login` | Staff operations portal |
| `http://127.0.0.1:5000/customer/login` | Customer self-service portal |

**Default admin credentials:**
```
Username: admin
Password: fuzi2026
```

The first run auto-creates technician accounts for the install team and department manager accounts, all with the temporary password `ChangeMe123!`. Reset these from the Team Accounts screen before sharing with your team.

Override defaults with environment variables before `users.json` is created:
```bash
FUZI_PORTAL_USER=your_user FUZI_PORTAL_PASSWORD=your_password FUZI_SECRET_KEY=your_secret .venv/bin/python app.py
```

### Costing Estimator *(new)*

Build professional elevator quotations and send bid reports directly to customers.

**New estimate form:**
- Elevator type: Residential Hydraulic, Residential MRL, Passenger (Commercial), Hospital / Stretcher, Industrial / Goods, Panoramic / Glass, Dumbwaiter, Escalator
- Capacity (4 to 20 persons)
- Number of floors / stops
- Drive: Hydraulic, Geared Traction, Gearless MRL, VFD Traction

**Live pricing:** Cost engine applies base + per-floor rates, capacity multipliers, and percentage uplifts for finish, door, drive, and control — all recalculated in real time as you change inputs.

**Actions:**
- **Save Estimate** — persists to `estimates.json` with status `Draft`
- **View Report** — opens a printable/shareable HTML quotation page
- **Send** — marks as `Sent`; if SMTP is configured sends the HTML report by email; otherwise opens your email client via `mailto:`
- Customers can **Accept** or **Decline** quotes from their portal

**Estimate statuses:** Draft → Sent → Accepted / Rejected

SMTP (optional): set `FUZI_SMTP_HOST`, `FUZI_SMTP_PORT`, `FUZI_SMTP_USER`, `FUZI_SMTP_PASS`, `FUZI_SMTP_FROM` to enable server-side delivery.

API: `GET /api/portal/estimates`, `POST /api/portal/estimates`, `PATCH /api/portal/estimates/<id>`, `GET /api/portal/estimates/<id>/report`, `POST /api/portal/estimates/<id>/send`, `POST /api/portal/estimates/calculate`

---

### Payment Tracking *(new)*

Track cashflow per estimate from advance to final sign-off. Open the **Payment Ledger** tab inside the Costing Estimator view.

**Staff workflow:**
1. Select a saved estimate from the dropdown — the ledger loads all milestones for that estimate.
2. **Auto-schedule** generates the standard 30 / 30 / 30 / 10 milestone split (Advance → Civil Work → Pre-Delivery → Sign-Off) with due dates at 0 / 30 / 60 / 90 days from a start date you choose. Returns a conflict warning if milestones already exist.
3. **Add Payment** manually creates a single milestone with any amount, due date, and description.
4. Mark individual rows **Paid** (sets paid date to today) or open **Edit** to update amount, method, reference number, notes, or status.
5. Delete rows as needed — no cascade effects.

**Summary cards (per estimate):**
- Total Contract Value, Amount Invoiced, Amount Received, Balance Outstanding, Overdue amount

**Payment statuses:** `Due` → `Paid` / `Overdue` / `Partial` / `Waived`

**Payment methods:** NEFT, UPI, Cheque, Cash, DD, Credit Card, Other

**Customer view:** Customers see a **Payments** tab on their portal with:
- Three headline cards: Total Contract Value / Amount Received / Balance Outstanding
- Per-estimate grouped table: Milestone · Amount · Due Date · Status · Paid Date · Method & Reference
- Overdue rows highlighted with a red left border; paid rows with green; due rows with amber
- Outstanding balance banner on the dashboard header when any amount is due

## Verification

```bash
# Syntax checks
.venv/bin/python -m py_compile app.py
node --check static/portal.js

# Data integrity
.venv/bin/python -m json.tool project_tickets.json
.venv/bin/python -m json.tool users.json
.venv/bin/python -m json.tool customers.json
.venv/bin/python -m json.tool estimates.json
.venv/bin/python -m json.tool org_chart.json
.venv/bin/python -m json.tool attendance.json
```

**After starting Flask, verify:**

- Staff login works at `/portal/login`.
- `/portal/dashboard` redirects to login when logged out.
- Customer login works at `/customer/login`.
- Costing Estimator calculates live prices and saves estimates.
- "Send" on a saved estimate triggers the email client (or SMTP if configured).
- Customers can log in and view their quotes.
- Accept / Decline on a quote updates its status in the staff portal.
- "Grant Portal Access" on a customer row creates a customer login.
- Org chart renders the company tree and edits persist.
- Attendance register saves check-in/out times and statuses.
- Search and status filters affect matching dashboard rows.
